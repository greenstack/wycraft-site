            Season Two of the Wycraft server started in June 2021, shortly after the release of Minecraft
            1.17. Because of Greenstack's new job, the early season was plagued with crashes, which were
            resolved once the server hardware was upgraded to something more capable.

            Wycraft 1024 was a short-lived server where we lived in a confied 1024x1024 region while waiting for the 1.17 update.
            However, due to lack of block accessibility and the small amount of space, interest quickly died down.

            Season One of the Wycraft server was started in late 2020 and ended about a month before the release of Minecraft 1.17.
            Originally hosted on Aternos, after some performance issues, everyone agreed to move the server to a machine that Greenstack
            has access to.
